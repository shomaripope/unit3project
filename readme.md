*This app was created to allow members to log in and post their favorite spot to go for various reasons, mainly, to bring a date. These places can also be viewed by other members. The spots can only be deleted through the members' as not to allow everyone to delete spots. 

*An addition i would like to add would be images and more css. also i would like a secured login for members and take the delete button off the main location spots page, as not to confuse users.
